## ⚡ Buck Converter – ECE 302H

**Overview:**  
Designed, assembled, and tested a PWM-controlled DC–DC buck converter to step down 10–16 V inputs using discrete power electronics components.

**Key Features:**
- NMOS power MOSFETs with gate driver IC
- LC output filter
- Op-amp–based high-side current sensing
- Tested under 10W resistive load

**Skills Used:**
Power Electronics, PCB Assembly, Soldering, Oscilloscope Debugging, KiCad, Analog Feedback

## 🐾 Save Simba – LC-3 Assembly Game (ECE 306H)

**Overview:**  
A grid-based game written entirely in LC-3 assembly. The world is dynamically loaded from memory using a linked list, and the player moves through the grid while tracking life count and collisions.

**Key Features:**
- Linked-list based world loading
- Player movement and boundary checking
- Collision detection with enemies and power-ups
- Subroutine-based state management

**Skills Used:**
LC-3 Assembly, Linked Lists, Low-Level State Machines, Memory Addressing, Debugging

## 🧮 Postfix Expression Evaluator – ARM Assembly (ECE 306H)

**Overview:**  
Bare-metal ARM assembly program that converts fully parenthesized infix expressions into postfix and evaluates them using a stack-based algorithm.

**Key Features:**
- Infix → Postfix conversion
- Stack-based expression evaluation
- Bare-metal ARM execution (virtual board + TI MSPM0 tooling)

**Skills Used:**
ARM Assembly, Stacks, Parsing Algorithms, Low-Level Debugging, Embedded Toolchains
